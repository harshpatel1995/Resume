\large{Your recent post for the search of a bioinformatics intern on Glassdoor has catched my attention. Soon to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science with a year's experience of learning and building bioinformatics tools, please consider my application for this internship.}

\hspace{4.0cm}
\large{Besides learning general-purpose programming throughout my undergraduate career, I've worked with three fellow CS students to design and implement a \textbf{bioinformatics pipeline} for the bioinformatics cluster at my university using \textbf{C++, Python and Bash Scripting}. As a result, I've gained exposure to many bioinformatics concepts and publicly available tools over the past year. I've become familiar with topics in \textbf{cellular biology, read mapping, abundance estimation} and \textbf{data visualization}.}

\vspace{0.30cm}
\hspace{4.0cm}
\large{I plan on pursuing bioinformatics for my post-graduate studies in the future so this internship will be excellent opportnity for me to find future career opportunities.}
