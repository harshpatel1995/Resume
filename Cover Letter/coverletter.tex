\large{Your recent post for the search of a bioinformatics software engineer on Glassdoor has catched my attention. Soon to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science along with a year's experience of learning and developing bioinformatics tools, please consider my application for this full-time role.}

\large{Through my undergraduate studies I've become familiar with and have utilized general-purpose programming languages like C, C++, Java and Python. For the past year, I've worked with three fellow CS students to design and implement a bioinformatics pipeline for the bioinformatics cluster at my university. Through this experience, I've become comfortable with git, bash scripting in UNIX, molecular biology and bioinformatics tools. I've enjoyed working on the project so I'm currently enrolled in directed research study as an elective improving the pipeline directly with the lead of the bioinformatics cluster at my university.}

\large{I've worked a semester as a teaching assistant for Database Management Systems where I've reinforced my knowledge of SQL and XML. One of my duties was answering students' course questions which improved my communication skills in a professional setting. I've also learnt to interact with customers through my three years of retail experience.}
