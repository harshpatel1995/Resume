\raggedright{\large{Dear Hiring Manager, }}
\\
\vspace{0.40cm}
\hspace{4.0cm}
\large{Your recent post for the search of an associate computational biologist on Glassdoor has catched my attention. Soon to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science with a year's experience of learning and developing bioinformatics tools, please consider my application for this position.}

\vspace{0.30cm}
\hspace{4.0cm}
\large{The position requires experience with Linux, general-purpose programming in C or Java, and an understanding of statistical computing in R or Python. I've learnt general-purpose progamming concepts throughout my undergraduate career. I've worked with three fellow CS students to design and implement a \textbf{bioinformatics pipeline} for the bioinformatics cluster at my university using \textbf{C++, Python and Bash Scripting}. I understand elementary cloud-computing principles having utilized \textbf{Amazon Web Services (AWS)} in the past.}

\vspace{0.30cm}
\hspace{4.0cm}
\large{As a CS student, I've learnt bioinformatics concepts and tools working on the pipeline over the past year. I've become familiar with topics in cellular biology, read mapping, abundance estimation and data visualization. Although I'm not familiar with studying psychiatric phenotypes, it seems it could generate encouraging and important results. }

\vspace{0.30cm}
\hspace{4.0cm}
\large{While utilizing my existing skills, the position will expose me to learning new topics in the domain. This is significant as I will be pursuing bioinformatics for higher education in the future. Please call me at 321-877-8184 or e-mail me at \href{mailto:hurr03@gmail.com}{hurr03@gmail.com} if you would like to know more. Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing my application.}
